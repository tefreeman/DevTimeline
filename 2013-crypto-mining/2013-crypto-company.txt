Subject: Limited Offer to Invest in Minors

So, except for John Cline (who we are waiting to hear from) the rest of us are in.  We are going to invest in the youth of America.  We are going to take our hard earned dollars and invest in a bushiness plan that none of us really understand that was developed by 2 sixteen year olds. It goes without saying that all of us are well educated, sophisticated business people who independently made their own decision and did not rely on any representations made by the minors, and certainly not the business prospectus they threw together - aforesaid prospectus being the first they ever wrote without knowledge that guarantees are never given and appropriate disclaimers must be included.  That being said, the minors, through legal counsel, now hereby disclaim, disavow, withdraw, rescind and declare null and void any prior guarantees, assurances, promises, and representations, written or oral, about anything, including their ability to turn invested funds into returns.

By investing, you acknowledge, warrant and represent that you are investing in the skills and talents of two sixteen year old young men, who have no track record of business success, tend to be optimistic about things, sometimes fudge the truth to get what they want, and have had numerous other crazy ideas that flopped. You understand all of this, but it is still you decision to invest your hard earned money in their crazy half baked get rich idea.  You, of course, are prepared to lose all of your investment.  In fact, you expect too.

Your investment may be used by minors for any and all lawfulness purposes, including, but not limited to, the acquisition of hardware and the payment of utilities necessary to mine bitcoins and litecoins.  Indeed, the minors work fast and attached is the equipment already ordered.  Depending on schoolwork and soccer practice and games, minors anticipate being fully operational by the end of the week, and generating coins by the following week. This is not a guarantee, only their overly optimistic musings.

Since minors lack the ability to lawfully contract, there will be no contracts. Everything will by trust and handshake. If you ever want your money back, tough.  Don't invest it!  If you want a distribution at some point, you can request it, but don't count it, the minors have re-investment plans.

Now on to the deal.  The minors initially proposed that adults would invest all necessary funds for hardware acquisition, and profits would be split 80% to minors and 20% to adults. Silly kids.  Adults countered and minors accepted forming a contract which has no legal effect or validity, but which established a relationship of trust.  The oral unenforceable contract we have agreed to is as follows:

1.  Investors will pool funds for purposes of hardware acquisition, utility bill coverage, and misc expenses. Purpose is to cover all costs and expenses of minors. Each investor will invest the same amount.  Each investor will be entitled to the same % of profit distribution. But only investors Dr. John Jebeles and Mike Freeman shall have any questioning or disciplinary authority over the minors.  To illustrate, all mining activity may be shut down at anytime for exams, bad grades or bad attitude. Non-parental investors shall have no rights or recourse if such actions occur, but shall have a lien to extent of their investment on any purchased hardware.

2.  Minors will acquire, build, install and operate one system to mine coins as market conditions dictate in order to prove technology works and generates revenue in the form of coins, which can be exchanged or converted into US$ or gold.  This is Phase I.

3.  Revenue generated by minors through their efforts will be used as follows: a. Pay back investors initial investment, b. after payback split 50/50 between investors and minors.  Investors shall split their 50% in equal shares as all investors shall have invested the same amount.  If any investor fails to make initial investment within 48 hours of specific monetary request, other investors shall have the right to split such share.

4. After total number of investors is known (investors limited to those on this email), and after initial costs calculated, an email will be sent to investors with the amount of initial investment, which will also include an amount to cover electricity for 3 months and other misc expenses.  Investors, unless required by law, shall have no rights to audit anything.  Initial hardware costs were fronted by Freemans.  A copy of receipts is pasted below.

5.  Minors will provide periodic updates on status of venture consistent with other obligations, such as schoolwork.

6.  The goal and objective is for minors to prove technology works and will generate revenue, either in the form of US$ or gold.  Once minors have proven technology to investors satisfaction, minors will propose a plan for beginning Phase II, which will involve the acquisition of more hardware.

PS.  Yes, I have multiple conflicts of interest.  Tough.  If you don't like it, don't invest.  Minors have asked me to be the interface with investors (of which I am one) and I have agreed to do so.

PSS.  Sure could use a banker to determine amount of initial investment, open account and deposit funds in such account, and reimburse Freemans for acquiring hardware.  Any takers?
