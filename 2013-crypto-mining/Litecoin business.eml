Investments in markets do ok. Bought at 6.0 and its at 6.2 with a massive vo=
lume spike so it should climb.=20

-- I found out what direction we need to go with our business and that is de=
signing asic's and FPGA (miners for lite coins) not out yet. The profit for c=
oming out with something like this would be massive. Butterfly labs is a bil=
lion dollar company and they were the first for bit coin Asics. I'll be rese=
arching after wed. Also, Mr. Monroe know a lot about  Asics and FPGA we coul=
d use his help if we decide to move in this direction=20
