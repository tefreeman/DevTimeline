 back because of Tevor's interest in attending MIT.  Trevor reached out to =
Larry and one thing led to another and Larry would like to invest and has a=
greed to meet with the boys and help on technical issues. I think this is a=
 no brainer.  With Larry's $500, the boys are going to ask to buy a replica=
 of what they have as soon as they prove they have earned money by showing =
us the money.  They now say the $10K machine is not available. There is a w=
aiting list, which they might ask to get on, but we can discuss later.

Below is another bad article.  Looks the the twins that litigated with Mark=
 Zuckerburg the ownership of Facebook, are now trying to corner the bit coi=
n market and its worrying some people.

Well, nothing gold can stay. And so, as surely as the Bitcoin bubble expand=
ed, so the Bitcoin bubble appears to be on its way back in.

We may never know what started today's crash<http://techcrunch.com/2013/04/=
10/bitcoin-crash/> in the price of Bitcoin. Some Bitcoin enthusiasts are bl=
aming a DDOS attack on prominent Bitcoin exchanges, while others are, somew=
hat less credibly, blaming<https://twitter.com/bitcoin_txt/status/322053489=
482137600> a government plot to destroy faith in the Internet's favorite cr=
ypto-currency. But regardless of why, something major is happening. My 93.5=
23120 percent of a Bitcoin,which I bought<http://nymag.com/daily/intelligen=
cer/2013/04/i-bought-a-bitcoin.html> for $124.81 exactly a week ago and saw=
 shoot up to be worth nearly $250 at its peak, is now worth about $140. (Al=
though given Bitcoin's volatility, that price is probably obsolete as I wri=
te this.)

What's been most interesting to watch, throughout this whole weeklong saga,=
 is the relationship between the old Bitcoin community =97 the diehards who=
 have been touting the merits of virtual currency since 2009 and who popula=
te the threads on the Bitcoin subReddit<http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoin> =
=97 and the Johnny-come-latelies like me, who had heard of Bitcoin and vagu=
ely knew what it was, but didn't snap to attention and actually consider bu=
ying in until the price was on a wild upswing.

Most of the Bitcoin originals I've talked to over the course of the last we=
ek have been skeptical of Bitcoin noobs. That's understandable. Because whi=
le, sure, a sudden flock of interested buyers jacks up the price of Bitcoin=
s and makes a few early adopters an insanely large amount of money very qui=
ckly, most of those buyers won't stick around for long. And, moreover, maki=
ng money isn't really the end goal of the Bitcoin movement. The goal is to =
establish legitimacy and draw attention to the shortcomings of government-c=
ontrolled currency. For the last week, Bitcoin's price swings have made it =
seem anything but legitimate.

There is a case to be made that the sudden upswing in interest in Bitcoins =
has been a good thing for the alternative-currency movement, regardless of =
how far prices fall in the coming days. As I pointed out when I bought my B=
itcoin (and I think was apparent when I interviewed<http://nymag.com/daily/=
intelligencer/2013/04/inside-the-bitcoin-bubble-bitinstants-ceo.html> BitIn=
stant CEO Charlie Shrem this week), the main problem with Bitcoin right now=
 is that the entire infrastructure supporting it is a mess. Money is too ha=
rd to get in and out of the system, exchanges to buy and sell Bitcoin are c=
reaking under the weight of demand, and hackers can steal Bitcoins with no =
recourse.

Some hard-core Bitcoin enthusiasts, like Erik Voorhees, think that the curr=
ent surge of attention paid to Bitcoin will help on that front, by giving v=
enture capitalists a reason to invest in start-ups like Coinsetter<http://t=
echcrunch.com/2013/04/09/coinsetter-lands-500k-from-secondmarket-founder-ot=
hers-to-help-bring-leverage-shorting-to-bitcoin-trade/> that will, ultimate=
ly, make the market more resilient and sophisticated.

"Well remember it's important to make a distinction between buying coins to=
 speculate on price and building up infrastructure," Voorhees told<http://w=
ww.buzzfeed.com/jwherrman/the-man-who-gave-his-life-to-bitcoin> BuzzFeed's =
John Herrman. "Those who are into Bitcoin should do the latter, full time. =
The speculation is separate ... it's for anyone who wants to take a gamble =
on the volatile market."

Those enthusiasts also take the tack that the more people who hear about Bi=
tcoin, the more retail establishments will begin to accept it as currency, =
and the more its purchasing power will begin to resemble the dollar. (Alrea=
dy this week, we've had a winery<http://picnicwineco.com/bitcoin-for-wine/1=
051/> and a bar in midtown<http://money.cnn.com/2013/04/08/investing/bitcoi=
n-bar-new-york-city/> begin accepting Bitcoins.)

But what these optimists miss is that people don't just use the dollar beca=
use it's accepted at their favorite wineries. They use it because they trus=
t it. They trust that if five dollars can buy a box of Cheerios today, it c=
an buy one tomorrow too. And that trust is built on the fact that the U.S. =
dollar is backed by a government, exchanged in a market that is controlled =
by regulations, and controlled in a monetary system that is overseen by the=
 Federal Reserve.

There is a certain irony to the fact that Bitcoin enthusiasts are currently=
blaming<http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c3149/im_no_expert_on_the=
_subject_but_it_kind_of_looks/> today's price action on market manipulation=
, and wishing that there were some mechanism =97 like a circuit-breaker on =
exchanges =97 to keep prices somewhat stable. Because those measures would =
require a unilateral decision by a policy authority, and unilateral decisio=
ns by policy authorities are exactly what Bitcoins were created to protest.

When the financial system nearly collapsed in 2008, we had tools to stop th=
e economy from coming to a total, unfathomable halt. We had the Fed's emerg=
ency borrowing window. We had TARP. We had depositor guarantees, and we're =
putting in place laws to try to keep a similar crisis from happening again.

The Bitcoin economy, on the other hand, can't do anything to stop a collaps=
e once it's in motion. And the current panic of Bitcoin enthusiasts proves =
that while people hate currency manipulation and government intervention in=
 boom times, they're slightly fonder of it when the sky is falling.

really understand that was developed by 2 sixteen year olds. It goes withou=
t saying that all of us are well educated, sophisticated business people wh=
o independently made their own decision and did not rely on any representat=
ions made by the minors, and certainly not the business prospectus they thr=
ew together - aforesaid prospectus being the first they ever wrote without =
knowledge that guarantees are never given and appropriate disclaimers must =
be included.  That being said, the minors, through legal counsel, now hereb=
y disclaim, disavow, withdraw, rescind and declare null and void any prior =
guarantees, assurances, promises, and representations, written or oral, abo=
ut anything, including their ability to turn invested funds into returns.

By investing, you acknowledge, warrant and represent that you are investing=
 in the skills and talents of two sixteen year old young men, who have no t=
rack record of business success, tend to be optimistic about things, someti=
mes fudge the truth to get what they want, and have had numerous other craz=
y ideas that flopped. You understand all of this, but it is still you decis=
ion to invest your hard earned money in their crazy half baked get rich ide=
a.  You, of course, are prepared to lose all of your investment.  In fact, =
you expect too.

Your investment may be used by minors for any and all lawfulness purposes, =
including, but not limited to, the acquisition of hardware and the payment =
of utilities necessary to mine bitcoins and litecoins.  Indeed, the minors =
work fast and attached is the equipment already ordered.  Depending on scho=
olwork and soccer practice and games, minors anticipate being fully operati=
onal by the end of the week, and generating coins by the following week. Th=
is is not a guarantee, only their overly optimistic musings.

Since minors lack the ability to lawfully contract, there will be no contra=
cts. Everything will by trust and handshake. If you ever want your money ba=
ck, tough.  Don't invest it!  If you want a distribution at some point, you=
 can request it, but don't count it, the minors have re-investment plans.

Now on to the deal.  The minors initially proposed that adults would invest=
 all necessary funds for hardware acquisition, and profits would be split 8=
0% to minors and 20% to adults. Silly kids.  Adults countered and minors ac=
cepted forming a contract which has no legal effect or validity, but which =
established a relationship of trust.  The oral unenforceable contract we ha=
ve agreed to is as follows:

1.  Investors will pool funds for purposes of hardware acquisition, utility=
 bill coverage, and misc expenses. Purpose is to cover all costs and expens=
es of minors. Each investor will invest the same amount.  Each investor wil=
l be entitled to the same % of profit distribution. But only investors Dr. =
John Jebeles and Mike Freeman shall have any questioning or disciplinary au=
thority over the minors.  To illustrate, all mining activity may be shut do=
wn at anytime for exams, bad grades or bad attitude. Non-parental investors=
 shall have no rights or recourse if such actions occur, but shall have a l=
ien to extent of their investment on any purchased hardware.

2.  Minors will acquire, build, install and operate one system to mine coin=
s as market conditions dictate in order to prove technology works and gener=
ates revenue in the form of coins, which can be exchanged or converted into=
 US$ or gold.  This is Phase I.

3.  Revenue generated by minors through their efforts will be used as follo=
ws: a. Pay back investors initial investment, b. after payback split 50/50 =
between investors and minors.  Investors shall split their 50% in equal sha=
res as all investors shall have invested the same amount.  If any investor =
fails to make initial investment within 48 hours of specific monetary reque=
st, other investors shall have the right to split such share.

4. After total number of investors is known (investors limited to those on =
this email), and after initial costs calculated, an email will be sent to i=
nvestors with the amount of initial investment, which will also include an =
amount to cover electricity for 3 months and other misc expenses.  Investor=
s, unless required by law, shall have no rights to audit anything.  Initial=
 hardware costs were fronted by Freemans.  A copy of receipts is pasted bel=
ow.

5.  Minors will provide periodic updates on status of venture consistent wi=
th other obligations, such as schoolwork.

6.  The goal and objective is for minors to prove technology works and will=
 generate revenue, either in the form of US$ or gold.  Once minors have pro=
ven technology to investors satisfaction, minors will propose a plan for be=
ginning Phase II, which will involve the acquisition of more hardware.

PS.  Yes, I have multiple conflicts of interest.  Tough.  If you don't like=
 it, don't invest.  Minors have asked me to be the interface with investors=
 (of which I am one) and I have agreed to do so.

PSS.  Sure could use a banker to determine amount of initial investment, op=
en account and deposit funds in such account, and reimburse Freemans for ac=
quiring hardware.  Any takers?
