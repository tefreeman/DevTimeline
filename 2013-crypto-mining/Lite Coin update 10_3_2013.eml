Lite Coin update october 3rd 2013. We currently hold around 400$'s worth of
Litecoins with a steady decrease in lite coin price, the amount of
litecoins we own has gone up but the value has decreased. Are current
profits are minimal as power will eat up most of the profits. However,
Bitcoins have made a steady come back from its 80$ low to around 120$. Lite
coins generally follow the same trend as bitcoins. We are currently still
waiting for lite coins to respond to the bitcoin price increase before we
decide whether or not to sell any of our 200 lite coins. We are also
returning left over money that was not spent on the first machine as we
have no need for it. We have a total of $1866.38 dollars in the bank. We
have decided to return 1800 of the 1866.38 dollars back to the investors.
Each investor that gave 500 dollars will receive a check for 281.25. Carl
Moore will receive 112.5 dollars for his 200$ investment.

As of now we currently have 400$ in lite coins, 660$ in assets (hardware)
and -160$ in power. With the money in the bank we still under 70$ for each
investor.

Checks will be returned to the following people by hand: Mr. Cline, Mr
Hewitt, Mr. Jebeles, Mr. Freeman, Mr Hernandez.

 Mr. Monroe and Mr. Moore will be mailed the check.

They should be returned by this weekend
