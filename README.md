# Early Coding Adventures

Welcome to my personal archive of programming projects from my childhood and teenage years. This repository serves as a digital time capsule, capturing various phases of my growth as a programmer—from simple hacks to more ambitious projects aimed at solving real-world problems.

## Projects Overview

Each project in this repository represents a distinct chapter in my early coding journey. While some original project files were lost over time, I have included original emails, business plans, and other relevant documents wherever possible to provide a comprehensive view of each endeavor. Below is a detailed breakdown of the projects you'll find in this repository:

To ensure that no passwords or sensitive information remain in the following projects, I used two helper scripts, `git_search.py` and `file_search.py`, after running BFG.jar. 

Please note that these are not my only coding projects, just the ones I could find and include here.

### 2009 - x86 Assembly
- **Project Description**: Learned enough x86 assembly to bypass the "Command and Conquer" license key check, allowing a friend to play with me over a VPN local VLAN (Later bought him a copy). 
- **Contents**: Nothing

### 2010 - OpenfixTechnology.com
- **Project Description**: Created a website to help people fix technology issues themselves through detailed guides and walkthroughs.
- **Contents**: Website registration email

### 2011 - UAB Computer Forensics Camp
- **Project Description**: Applied skills learned at a forensic camp to investigate and report a phishing operation.
- **Contents**: Email stubs, the phishing website files

### 2013 - Crypto Mining Venture
- **Project Description**: Secured funding from local investors to design and manage a crypto mining setup, optimizing hardware for low power consumption. Successfully turned a profit for all investors.
- **Contents**: Original Emails

### 2014 - Optimal Upload
- **Project Description**: Developed a monetized file hosting service with video ads integration. 
- **Contents**: Website files

### 2016 - Sink
- **Project Description**: Created a crowd-based service platform called Sink to connect people with local service providers. Pitch: Welcome to Sink, the world’s first crowd-based service platform that connects people with problems to neighbors with solutions. From home repair to lawn care, and anything in between, just Sink it! 
- **Contents**: Website files

### 2017-2019 - Sift
- **Project Description**: I developed an AI-powered application to estimate calorie counts in dishes from menus by combining web scraping and machine learning. The project utilized Git for version control. Recently, to save time and optimize workflows, I created an AI summarization project that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze, embed, and summarize code files within a specified project directory. These summaries, combined with a high-quality model like ChatGPT-4, were then used to generate comprehensive GitHub READMEs for this and other old projects.

## Using This Repository

Each folder in this repository is dedicated to a different project. More recent projects contain folders and code files directly related to the project, while older projects may include Word documents and email stubs documenting the process and outcomes.

## Reflections

This repository not only showcases my technical skills but also my journey and growth as a developer. Each project taught me something new and brought me closer to where I am today.

Feel free to make a pull request if you want to marvel at my questionable coding choices, we all start from somewhere!
