# Dev Timeline

Welcome to my personal archive of programming projects from my childhood to now. This repository serves as a digital time capsule, capturing various phases of my growth as a programmer—from simple hacks to more ambitious projects aimed at solving real-world problems.

## Projects Overview

Each project in this repository represents a distinct chapter in my early coding journey. While some original project files were lost over time, I have included original emails, business plans, and other relevant documents wherever possible to provide a comprehensive view of each endeavor. Below is a detailed breakdown of the projects you'll find in this repository:

To ensure that no passwords or sensitive information remain in the following projects, I used two helper scripts, `git_search.py` and `file_search.py`, after running BFG.jar. 

Please note that these are not my only coding projects, just the ones I could find and include here.

### 2009 - x86 Assembly

## Using This Repository

Each folder in this repository is dedicated to a different project. More recent projects contain folders and code files directly related to the project, while older projects may include Word documents and email stubs documenting the process and outcomes.

## Reflections

This repository not only showcases my technical skills but also my journey and growth as a developer. Each project taught me something new and brought me closer to where I am today.

Feel free to make a pull request if you want to marvel at my questionable coding choices, we all start from somewhere!
